Description:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a secret word letter by letter before running out of attempts. This project is a text-based implementation of the Hangman game in Python.

How to Play:
The game randomly selects a secret word from a predefined list of words.
The player's goal is to guess the word letter by letter.
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
After each guess, the game will display the current state of the word, showing correctly guessed letters and placeholders for letters that haven't been guessed yet.
The game will also show the letters that have been incorrectly guessed so far.
The player wins if they successfully guess the entire word before using up all their attempts.
If the player runs out of attempts before guessing the word, the game ends, and the secret word is revealed.

Features:

User-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.
Randomly generated secret words from a curated list of words.
Option to set the number of attempts, making the game easier or more challenging.
Handling of repeated guesses (letters that have already been guessed).
Validation of input to ensure only single letters are accepted as guesses.
Display of the Hangman ASCII art, updating with each incorrect guess.
Game over message and option to play again.
Getting Started:
To run the Hangman game locally, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and execute the hangman.py script. Follow the prompts to make your guesses and enjoy the game!
